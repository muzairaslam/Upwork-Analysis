# Data Analysis of Upwork Market

## Upwork Background

- Upwork is one of the leading global freelance platforms. 

- 1 in 800 freelancers on Upwork makes more than $1000 per month.

- Web Design was the most in-demand tech skill on Upwork in 2021.

- Over 50% of all freelancers on Upwork provide clients with skilled services

- Web Programming (43%), Web Design (31%), and social media marketing (25%) were the top on-demand skills with the highest growth on Upwork in 2020 - 2021.

## Data Source

- [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmyalo/upwork-freelance-jobs-60k/)

- Scraped by Pakistani nationalist, resulting in location bias in job listings.

![](data-screenshot.png)

## Variables

- search_keyword: The term the scraper typed in the search bar to retrieve the specific row of results. Typed : `3D`, `Data Science`,  `Developer`, `Marketing`
- category_1 to category_9: These columns specify categories of skills that the client wrote as a relevant to the job
- client_country: the country from where the job was placed.

## Variables (Continued)
- payment_type: `"Fixed-price"` for the whole project at once & `"Hourly"` which pays per hour.
- job_cost: For `"Fixed-price"` projects only
- start_rate and end_rate: For `"Hourly"` projects only

## Loading Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(gt)
library(here)
library(plotly)
library(janitor)
```

## Load the raw data

```{r}
data <- (read_csv(here("data/data.csv")))
dim(data)
```

- The goal of `{here}` is to enable easy file referencing in project-oriented workflows. 

- In contrast to using `setwd()`, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files.

## Selecting Coloumns 

```{r}
# select columns for analysis
data_selected <- data |>
  clean_names() |>
  select(search_keyword,
         category_1,
         payment_situation,
         client_country,
         payment_type,
         job_cost,
         start_rate,
         end_rate)
```

- `clean_names()` from `{janitor}`automatically converts all your variable names to lower case and puts underscores in the gaps.


## View of Data Set

# Data cleaning

## Data Types Correction and Filtering

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

# correct data types
data_selected$search_keyword <- factor(data_selected$search_keyword)

# remove fixed price jobs where NAs are there
# keep fixed prices projects with max client budget of $5000 
# remove hourly contracts where end rate is not given by the client 
data_cleaned <- data_selected |>
  filter((!is.na(job_cost) & job_cost < 5000) | !is.na(end_rate))

dim(data_cleaned)
```
```{r}
data_remains <- (nrow(data_cleaned) / nrow(data_selected)) * 100
print(data_remains)
```

## Insights for Freelancers

- Development Projects on average gets $150 (n = 11468)
- Marketing Projects on average gets $150 (n = 6017)
